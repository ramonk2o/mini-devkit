# CHANGELOG.md

`CHANGELOG.md`, at the project root, records what changed in each version, for the people who use the product. It follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Entries

- **One or two sentences per change, from the user's point of view:** what they can now do, what works differently, what was fixed. Start with the feature's name in bold when it's a feature.
- **No detailed rules.** Edge cases, formats and conditions live in SPEC.md; the entry says what changed, not every rule of it. Copies drift.
- **Categories**, in this order, only those with entries: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security.
- New entries go under `## [Unreleased]`.
- Changes that don't affect the product (project docs, tooling) are recorded only if notable, and say so, e.g. "(project docs only, the product doesn't change)".
- Follow the existing file's wording style where it has one.

Example:

```markdown
### Added
- **Power and remainder in calculations**: `2^10=` (or `2**10=`) and `7%3=` now work, following the usual math rules.

### Fixed
- Plain-text copies keep line breaks made with Shift+Enter.
```

## Creating it

When the project has no `CHANGELOG.md`, create it:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
```

If the project already has released versions (git tags, a version in its manifest or package file), ask whether to reconstruct past versions from the git history or start from now.

## Releases

When the user releases a version:
1. **Pick the number** with Semantic Versioning: major for breaking changes, minor for new features, patch for fixes only. Propose it from the `[Unreleased]` entries; the user decides.
2. **Show** the version, the date and the entries that go into it, and wait for the OK.
3. **Move** the `[Unreleased]` entries under `## [<version>] — <YYYY-MM-DD>`, leaving `## [Unreleased]` empty above it. A short line under the heading can say where it went (e.g. "Submitted to the store as an update").
4. **Update the links** at the end of the file:
   ```markdown
   [Unreleased]: <repo>/compare/<version>...HEAD
   [<version>]: <repo>/compare/<previous>...<version>
   ```
   The first version links to `<repo>/tree/<version>`.
5. **Tag** the release commit with an annotated tag named like the existing tags (e.g. `1.4.0`), locally.
6. Push the commit and the tag, if the repository has a remote.

Other release steps (bumping the version in package or manifest files, building a package, submitting to a store) belong to the project: follow its instructions.
