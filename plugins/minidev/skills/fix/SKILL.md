name: fix
description: In projects set up for the minidev cycle (a CLAUDE.md that names it), fix a bug on its own branch, test-first when it can be reproduced in a test, record it in the changelog and merge it once confirmed. Use it whenever the user reports something broken or wrong in existing behavior, e.g. "X has a bug", "saving fails when…", "isso quebrou", "/fix X". Not for new behavior: that's a feature (document, then build).

# Fix

Fixes a bug: existing behavior that doesn't do what SPEC.md, the tests or the user expect. A bug has no backlog entry and no independent tester; its weight is in the test that reproduces it, so it can't come back unnoticed.

Talk to the user in the language of the conversation. Project instructions (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md…) define the test and build commands and what only shows in the real app; when they conflict with this skill, they win.

## 1. Check it's a bug

First check that the project uses the cycle, as in the `build` skill's Start section; if it doesn't, offer `/minidev:setup` or simply fix the bug without this skill.

If fixing it means deciding how the product should behave (two reasonable answers, or a rule SPEC.md doesn't cover), it's a feature: say so and record it with the `document` skill instead.

## 2. Fix

1. Create a `fix/<short-name>` branch the same way the `build` skill creates a feature's branch (Start, step 4).
2. If the bug can be reproduced in a test, write the test and show that it fails for the reason reported. Then fix the code until it, the whole suite and the build pass.
3. If it only shows in the real app, fix it and keep the steps to reproduce it for the commit message.

## 3. Finish

1. With the `document` skill, record the fix in CHANGELOG.md under Fixed, and in SPEC.md if a rule changed.
2. Commit code, tests and documents on the branch in one commit. If the fix needs checking in the real app, end the message with a block starting with a line that says exactly `To check by hand:`, with the steps to reproduce the bug, one per line.
3. Show the user what to check, if anything, and wait for their confirmation.
4. Merge, delete the branch and push as in the `build` skill's Finish section (step 5), with `fix/<short-name>` in place of the feature's branch.
